# kedro_mnist_package

## Overview

The README file provides the steps to install and deploy the project using the .whl file generated by kedro package commad

## Prerequiste
Create a new folder and copy .whl, data and conf-<package_name>.tar.gz to this folder
The project needs Python 3.10.0 version. Please create a virtual enviornment using the following command:

```
python -m venv <env_name>
```
e.g. python -m venv MNIST_Kedro

Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:
```
activate <env_name> 
```
e.g. activate MNIST_Kedro

Incase of conda, use the following command:

```
conda activate MNIST_Kedro
```
## Installation
Use the following command to install .whl file:

```
pip install  <package_name>.whl
```
e.g. pip install tcs_kedro_mnist-0.1-py3-none-any.whl

This will install the kedro_mnist package and required dependencies.

## Running and Execution
To execute the entire pipeline, use the following command:

```
python -m tcs_kedro_mnist --conf-source="conf-<package_name.tar.gz" 
```
e.g. python -m tcs_kedro_mnist --conf-source="conf-tcs_kedro_mnist.tar.gz"

To run a specific pipeline, use the following command:

```
python -m tcs_kedro_mnist --conf-source="conf-<package_name>.tar.gz" --pipeline <pipeline_name>
```
e.g. python -m tcs_kedro_mnist --conf-source="conf-tcs_kedro_mnist.tar.gz" --pipeline data_processing
